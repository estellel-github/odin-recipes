  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <h3>LEMON PASTRY CREAM</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>In a medium pot, heat over low the milk, the cream and lemon rind, until very hot but do not boil. Remove from heat and let cool to warm.</li>
    <li>In a medium pot add the yolks and sugar, whisk together until combined, then add the flour and vanilla, whisk again until smooth, place the pot over medium / low heat, pour the warm milk/cream through a sieve to remove the lemon rind (discard), whisk continuously until thickened. Move to a glass bowl, cover with plastic wrap (make sure wrap touches the cream mixture and refrigerate approximately 2 hours. You may need to rewhip it if it is really thick.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>CROSTATA DOUGH</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>In a large bowl whisk together the flour, salt, sugar and baking powder, make a well in the centre and add the egg, egg yolk and butter (cubed), mix together (you can also use a food processor, pulse until dough just starts to come together), remove dough to a lightly floured flat surface and knead until it becomes a soft dough, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 30-60 minutes.</li>
    <li>Pre-heat oven to 350F (180C) Grease and flour a 12 medium muffin tin.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>PUTTING IT TOGETHER</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Remove the dough from the fridge, and place on a lightly floured surface knead a few times to soften it up. Roll to 1/8" thickness (or a little thicker if you prefer), cut out circles (approximately 3 1/2 inch / 8 1/2 cm size) and fit into the muffin pan. Prick the bottom of the dough with the tongs of a fork and then fill almost to the top with the pastry cream.</li>
    <li>Wet the rim of each tart with a little water top with another cut out circle, cut with a knife to remove excess dough and seal with fingers. (seals better with fingers lightly dipped in water). When complete, brush the top of each tart with the egg wash and bake for approximately 30-40 minutes, or until golden brown. Let cool about 15 minutes in the muffin pan then move to a wire rack to cool completely, dust with powdered sugar before serving. Enjoy!</li>
